This program is intended to allow the user to define multiple matrices of any size.

Once the matrices are defined the user can then perform operations such as:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Scalar Multiplication
- Matrix Multiplication
- Calculate Determinent
- Find inverse


Example
--------
    
m1 = [2 1] m2= [1 4] 
     [0 9]     [4 0]


m1 + m2 = [3 5]
	  [4 9]
 




The user can use commands to manipulate the matrices:

Commands			Description
---------			------------

- Create <name>			(create a new matrix)
- Delete <name>			(delete a matrix)
- Load	 <name>			(load values into the matrix sequentially)
- Resize <name rows cols>	(resize the matrix)
- Store	 			(store a value in a particular row and column)
- File <filename> <name>	(reads a matrix from a file)
